# ClearMeasure

FizzBuzz will cycle through numbers (ceiling specified by user) and print them out automatically!

Moreover, users are able to override a numbers output, with one or more textual substitutions, provided said number is evenly divisible by another! 
These number substitutions are configurable; see the driver appsettings.json file as an example.

Enjoy!
